## Project Overview
The **Waste Food Delivery Network** aims to reduce food waste by allowing food donors (restaurants, events, households) to quickly list surplus food. The platform then connects these donors with delivery partners who transport the food to beneficiaries such as food banks, shelters, and individuals in need. 

By minimizing waste and offering an efficient food redistribution system, this project seeks to positively impact both the community and the environment.

## Key Features
- **User Registration and Role-Based Access**
  - Donors, Delivery Partners, and Beneficiaries can register and access role-specific functionalities.

- **Donation Request Portal**
  - Donors can submit information about available food, including quantity, type, and pickup time.

- **Real-Time Notifications**
  - Delivery partners are notified of new donation requests nearby.

- **Geolocation and Route Optimization**
  - Integration with Google Maps API for efficient route planning and location tracking.

- **Admin Dashboard**
  - Manage users, track food donation metrics, and generate reports on the platform’s impact.

- **Status Updates and Real-Time Tracking**
  - Real-time status updates from pickup to delivery.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Geolocation**: Google Maps API
- **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging / Twilio
- **Hosting**: AWS, Netlify (frontend) / Digital Ocean
